  "description": "You are piloting a rocket across the solar system. This solar system includes a sun, three orbiting planets — the middle of which is Earth, your destination — and a moon orbiting Earth. You may assume that the planets and satellite follow a circular orbit, unless you know something about the geometry of orbits and want to make your program more realistic. You succeed by reaching Earth; you fail if hit any other heavenly body, or if you run out of fuel. (Oh, did we mention you have only a limited amount of fuel?)",
